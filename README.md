## Dependencies

This project uses python 3. To install dependencies run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Problem Statement

There are different types of experience replay, e.g. prioritized experience replay and hindsight experience replay. Compare two or more types of experience replay. Does the ‘winner’ depend on the type of environment?

## Experience Replays
We mainly experimented with three experience replays techniques which are:
```
- Naive Experience Replay 
- Prioritized Experience Replay
- Combined Experience Replay
```
